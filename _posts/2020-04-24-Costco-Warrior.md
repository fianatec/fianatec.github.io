My life fades. <br/>
The vision dims. <br/>
All that remains are memories. <br/>
I remember a time of chaos. <br/>
Ruined dreams. <br/>
This wasted land. <br/>
But most of all, I remember the Costco Warrior.<br/> 
The man we called “Dan”.<br/>

<p/>
To understand who he was, you have to go back to another time.<br/> 
When the world reached for the white paper. <br/>
And the suburbs sprouted great wholesale warehouses filled with rotisserie roast chickens and palettes of 1000 sheet Charmin UltraSoft. <br/>
Gone now, flushed away. <br/>
For reasons long forgotten, the mighty warrior tribes’ leaders wigged out and waged war on their own peoples and touched off a blaze which engulfed them all.<br/>
Without bath tissue, they were nothing. <br/>
They’d built a house of straw. The toilets clogged and overflowed. <br/>
Their leaders strained and strained and strained. <br/>
But nothing could stem the flooded cesspool tsunami.<br/>
 Their world crumbled. The cities exploded. <br/>
 A whirlwind of senior only lines, home-made facemasks, and “one sheet per” visits. <br/>
 A firestorm of fear. Men began to feed on men (takeout only).

<p/>
On the roads it was a bare cardboard tube nightmare. <br/>
Only those mobile enough to scavenge, brave enough to break curfew could hope to keep fresh. <br/>
The gangs took over the highways, ready to wage war for a damaged roll of janitorial 2-ply. <br/>
And in this maelstrom of hemorrhoids and piles, ordinary men were battered and smashed. <br/>
Men like Dan. The warrior Dan. With the ba-woosh of a power flush, he lost everything. <br/>
And became a shell of a man, a burnt out, desolate man, a man haunted by the demons of his past, a man who wandered out into the wasteland. <br/>
And it was here, in this blighted place, that he learned to “enjoy the go” again ...”
