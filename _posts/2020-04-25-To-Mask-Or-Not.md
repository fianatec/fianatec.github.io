﻿To mask, or not to mask, that is the question:<br/>
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer<br/>
The venal scowl of fellow supermarket shoppers,<br/>
Or to drop arms against a sea of ‘tussis<br/>
venturing out, under aegis of rent cloth. To cough—to sneeze,<br/>
No more; and by a sneeze to say we end<br/>

<p/>
The heart-ache and the thousand sheet roll of 3-ply<br/>
That flesh is heir to: 'tis a sternutation<br/>
Devoutly to be wish'd. To cough, to sneeze;<br/>
To expectorate, perchance to clear one’s throat —ay, there's the rub:<br/>
For in that nagging hack of Wuhan what dreams may come,<br/>
When we have shuffled out of shelter in place,<br/>
Out into the armpit of this great nation,<br/>
Must give us pause—there's the respect<br/>
That makes calamity of a sniffle, a frog in one’s windpipe.<br/>

<p/>
For who would bear th’whooping wheeze,<br/>
Th'oppressor's executive orders, the proud man's farmer’s blow,<br/>
The pangs of dispriz'd haircuts, the social distancing<br/>
The insolence of coercive enforcement, and the spurns<br/>
once good neighbors merit of th'unworthy excursions,<br/>
When he himself might his quietus make<br/>
With but a bare visage? Who would shopping trolley bear,<br/>
To rasp and bark under a palette of Charmin Ultrasoft,<br/>
But that the dread of something after covid-19,<br/>
The undiscovere'd Costco, from whose isles<br/>
No hoarder returns, puzzles the will,<br/>
And makes us rather bear interminable queues we have<br/>
Than break curfew in seek of kinder lines that we know not of?<br/>
<p/>
Thus Corona does make cowards of us all,<br/>
And thus the native hue of panic<br/>
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of psychosis,<br/>
And enterprises of bat-shiat hysterical freaking out,<br/>
Stay at Home! (Unless you need to go out),<br/>
And forever lost - that best shave money could buy.<br/>
