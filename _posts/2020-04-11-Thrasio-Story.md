So what does Thrasio actually do? 

<p/>
It’s pretty simple really. It finds the “top-reviewed, bestselling” essential everyday products on Amazon, and buys the brands from the small business owners. Many of those (usually seven-figure) businesses have grown faster than the owners have expected, according to Silberstein.

“These kinds of businesses are easy to get started but when they succeed, they become harder to manage over time,” he told Crunchbase News. “We’re able to come in and give them a terrific outcome for something they’ve built they might not have had otherwise.”

Thrasio comes in, pays these often mom and pop shop owners upwards of $1 million for their business, and then integrates the brands.

“We’re not interested in fad products,” Cashman emphasizes.

So far, Thrasio has acquired 43 businesses in all-cash transactions and integrated them onto its proprietary operating platform. It then works to optimize them through branding and search, for example. Products include Beast Gear, a fitness equipment brand; TrailBuddy Hiking Poles, a seller of anti-fatigue floor mats and Pet Deodorizer.
